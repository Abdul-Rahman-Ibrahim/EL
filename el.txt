Hello,

I am a student at Vrije University studying computer science. My unlce, the owner of El Travel and Events, wants an update to his website,
specifically the Travel Management Template.

My uncle described to me what needs to be updated and having some basics knowleged in html, I was able to make a template of what my uncle wants
to be updated.

I will give a brief explanation to what needs to be updated and then I will attach a link to the template so that you have a fair idea of what
the webpage should look like.


The Travel Management webpage should be divided into 4 sections, each having a link to a newly created web page. The newly created web page should
be a form prospective customer can put their information into. I am listing each section below.

1. Visa Application      --> Has link to a Form in a new webpage
2. Passport Application  --> Has link to a Form in a new webpage
3. Shuttles and Pick ups --> Has link to a Form in a new webpage
4. Tour Services         --> Has link to a Form in a new webpage

Please the Form for each section has different information.

Please the template I am going to attach is created without styling and does not necessarily mean the webpage to be updated does not require styling.
The template is just to show you how the webpage should be divided into sections and what forms they are directed to when each section's link is clicked.
